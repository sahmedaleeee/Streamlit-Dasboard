# Consumer Finance Complaints ETL and Dashboard

This repository contains my project focused on automating the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of consumer complaint data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) API into Google Sheets, followed by dashboard creation using Python and Streamlit. The project leverages Google Cloud APIs and integrates the ETL process into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) flow to ensure seamless data processing, even in the case of interruptions.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to automate the data pipeline, making it robust and reliable for continuous data extraction and transformation. The data is retrieved from the CFPB Consumer Complaints API, processed through a series of ETL steps, and loaded into Google Sheets. The automated flow ensures that the data is up-to-date, even if an interruption occurs, by handling retries within the DAG flow. Finally, the processed data is used to create an interactive dashboard in Python using Streamlit, providing valuable insights into consumer complaints.

## Key Achievements

- **Automated Data Extraction**: Connected to the Consumer Finance API to fetch consumer complaint data regularly.
- **ETL Process**: Performed data cleaning, transformation, and enrichment steps to prepare the data for analysis and reporting.
- **Google Cloud Integration**: Utilized Google Cloud APIs to load the processed data into Google Sheets, making it easily accessible for further use.
- **DAG Flow Integration**: Implemented a DAG flow to automate the ETL pipeline, ensuring that the process remains resilient and continues seamlessly in case of any interruptions.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built a dynamic dashboard in Python using Streamlit, allowing for real-time visualization and analysis of consumer complaint data.
- **Scalable Design**: Designed the ETL and dashboard system to be easily scalable, allowing for future expansions and additional data sources.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **API Integration**: Extracted data from the CFPB Consumer Complaints API and Google Cloud APIs for seamless data flow.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleaned and transformed raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis and reporting.
- **ETL Automation**: Designed a robust ETL pipeline with DAG flow integration to ensure uninterrupted data processing.
- **Google Sheets Automation**: Automated data loading into Google Sheets using Google Cloud API, enabling real-time data access.
- **Dashboard Development**: Created a user-friendly dashboard in Python using Streamlit, providing valuable insights through interactive visualizations.

## Summary

This project showcases my ability to build a complete automated ETL pipeline and a dynamic dashboard, demonstrating expertise in API integration, data transformation, and real-time visualization. The work emphasizes robust, scalable, and reliable data processing methods that can be adapted to various use cases.
